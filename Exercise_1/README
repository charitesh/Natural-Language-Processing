This project demonstrates how to process unstructured text data from a dataset of Magic: The Gathering cards and turn it into a structured format suitable for analysis. Each card contains information such as its name, mana cost, type, and effect.

The exercise covers:

Loading and reading text files in Python

Splitting text into individual records

Extracting structured information using regular expressions

Creating a pandas DataFrame for analysis

Counting and analyzing specific fields (e.g., card types)
